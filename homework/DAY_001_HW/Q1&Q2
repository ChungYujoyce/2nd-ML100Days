作業1：

請上 Kaggle, 在 Competitions 或 Dataset 中找一組競賽或資料並寫下：

1. 你選的這組資料為何重要

2. 資料從何而來 (tips: 譬如提供者是誰、以什麼方式蒐集)

3. 蒐集而來的資料型態為何

4. 這組資料想解決的問題如何評估

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Why it's important:
Since it's related to human survive in huge disaster , and how to prevent in the future if another tragedy happens.

Provider:
It's previded by "Kaggle Learn" to help everyone learn about ML.

Data type: 
Numbers(binary) , stored in .csv files

By using this set of data ,we can predict if a passanger can survive or not by machine learning model.
By analyzing passanger's height , weight, gender, and other data which may has high relationship with survival rate.

作業2：

想像你經營一個自由載客車隊，你希望能透過數據分析以提升業績，請你思考並描述你如何規劃整體的分析/解決方案：

1. 核心問題為何 (tips：如何定義 「提升業績 & 你的假設」)
    Not enough clients, we have to enhance sales performance.
    We suppose that our amount of sales is decreasing,so we have to improve our saling stradegies.
2. 資料從何而來 (tips：哪些資料可能會對你想問的問題產生影響 & 資料如何蒐集)
    We may make some survey about customers' feeling and feedback about us to get the market condition. 
    Or the sales number of each month to observe if the number is really decreasing.
    We makes a track and store data whenever a sale is successfully done ,thus if we want to check a certain sale,
    search information in computer will do.
    
3. 蒐集而來的資料型態為何
    It may be stored in excel files(sales amount)
    
4. 你要回答的問題，其如何評估 (tips：你的假設如何驗證)
    If we suppose our amount of sales is really decreasing,by getting customers feedback, we can have some discount activities to get more customers , or have some VIP sort of things to attract more customers.
    If the sales number inhance after out changes for one year,we can conclude that out stradegy success,else we need to make another change.
